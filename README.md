To be implemted:

- Fix the Finish Game page
- Add more clips, make the game score out of 10
- Added a symbol, telling the player if its Easy/Medium/Hard
- Maybe: Add a new mode, where it's audio only, and you get more points if you guess correctly.
- Maybe: Login page, that would that and save scores
